### Introduction

#### stringToLong

This contains the code to convert a string to a long. It doesn't
accept input other than strings. It doesn't accept inputs with
fractional parts since Python's long are whole numbers (I could've
just considered the ceiling of the fraction).


#### triNary

This contains the code for the tri-nary tree. I've added insert and
delete operations to the tree. I've also added some misc functions
such as has_value, find_min, and is_ternary_tree for testing and other
functions.

### To run the unit tests

    $ python run_tests.py
